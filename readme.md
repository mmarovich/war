# War: The Card Game

How to play "War: The Card Game"
	Each player takes half the deck and plays one card from the top of their deck.  Whoever is highest wins both cards.  In the event of a tie, two cards are wagered for the next round.  First player to win the entire deck wins.

This app was written using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, and AJAX, and is also a very good example of CSS animations. The API used is here: [Deck of Cards](https://deckofcardsapi.com/).

The API uses a virtual deck of cards, which can be manipulated through various paths and parameters.  Every url generated in the javascript code has a "Deck ID" so that the API can keep track of which cards are being manipulated.

The user interface is very simple.  There are three buttons.  The first button is a "shuffle and deal" button to start the game.  The second is the "attack" button, which is used to initiate each round of cards, and the last is a "start over" button to play again.
